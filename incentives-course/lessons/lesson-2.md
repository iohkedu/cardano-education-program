### Lesson 2: It's Not All About the Money... But It Helps!

#### **Types of Incentives**

When we talk about incentives, most people immediately think of money. On Cardano, these are the

**monetary incentives** paid out in ADA as **staking rewards**.

But there are other, non-monetary motivators too, like idealism, morality, or just the simple desire to "do the right thing". For example, a user might choose to delegate to a pool run by a charity that uses its operator rewards to fund a good cause, even if that pool offers slightly lower returns than another.

The primary design goal for Cardano's incentives was to align the monetary incentives with these non-monetary, moral ones. The system is built so that, ideally, nobody should have to neglect their own financial interests to do what is right for the network.

#### **A Tale of Misaligned Incentives: A Lesson from Bitcoin**

Getting this alignment right is notoriously tricky, and many other blockchain projects highlight the conflict between individual and collective interests.

Let's look at Bitcoin as an example. Bitcoin "miners" (the equivalent of Cardano's stake pool operators) are paid in proportion to the number of blocks they add. Since mining has significant costs, operators have a strong financial incentive to merge into "mining pools". By pooling their resources, two miners can share the costs of hardware and operations, lowering their total expenses while their expected rewards remain the same.

From a purely financial standpoint, this makes perfect sense for the miners. But for the network, it's a huge problem. It leads to

**centralization**, as pools grow ever larger. The security of Bitcoin relies on the core assumption that no single entity controls more than 50% of the network's power.

This isn't just a theoretical worry. In 2014, a mining pool called GHash.io actually exceeded 51% of Bitcoin's mining power for several days, causing significant concern in the community. The situation was only resolved when the pool voluntarily reduced its power and promised to stay below a 40% threshold in the future. This was a clear case where the financial interests of participants directly conflicted with the security of the network.

Cardano's incentive system was designed from the ground up to prevent these conflicts. By simply following their best financial interests, participants should also be doing the right thing for the network.
