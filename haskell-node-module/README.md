# Cardano Node Course

## Introduction

This course provides a structured introduction to the **Cardano Node**, the core software that powers the Cardano blockchain.  
It is designed for learners who want to understand the architecture of Cardano, its layered design, and how its components—Ledger, Consensus, Networking, and Scripting—work together to deliver decentralization, security, and smart contract functionality.

The lessons are based on real-world Cardano Node documentation and research, helping you build a strong foundation to run, develop, or contribute to the Cardano ecosystem.

## How to Use This Course

- **Prerequisites**:
  - Basic understanding of blockchain concepts.
  - Familiarity with programming (Haskell knowledge is helpful but not required).
  - Interest in distributed systems and decentralized technologies.

- **Learning Path**:
  1. Begin with the introduction to the Cardano Node to get an overview of its purpose and architecture.
  2. Study the Ledger and Consensus layers to understand how transactions and blocks are validated.
  3. Explore the Network layer to see how Cardano achieves peer-to-peer communication at scale.
  4. Conclude with the Scripting layer to learn how Plutus smart contracts integrate with the Cardano Node.

- **Suggested Exercises**:
  - Set up and run a local Cardano node.
  - Inspect logs and trace how transactions propagate through the network.
  - Explore writing and testing simple Plutus scripts.
