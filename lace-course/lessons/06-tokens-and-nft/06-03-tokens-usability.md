# 6.3 Usability of tokens and NFTs

Native tokens can have a market price, which may increase for the following reasons:

* Images and short videos associated with tokens that can represent artwork  
* Real-world assets backing tokens, as fiat currencies or hard assets, as gold  
* Functionality of tokens that have some real-world usage associated with them.

The previous section explained how to create NFTs using an embedded image. But tokens can also be created for other purposes. If tokens are backed by real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or precious metals, they are called *stablecoins*.

A **stablecoin** is a token backed by another asset, such as a physical good like precious metals or a fiat currency. *Being backed* means the company that created the stablecoins keeps a reserve of the asset that backs the coins. Because of this, a stablecoin maintains a stable price, equivalent to the asset backing it. Markets then determine the actual price of the stablecoin, which is usually close to the actual price of the asset.  

Stablecoins can also be backed by a basket of multiple assets, such as two or more fiat currencies. In that case, the price is determined by the average price of all the assets. Stablecoins can be used by businesses that want to sell their product or service for crypto and want to avoid the price fluctuations of regular cryptocurrencies. Also, traders can use stablecoins to safeguard their assets when the price of a cryptocurrency is falling.

Tokens not backed by other assets may still have a price on the market because of their functionality. Such tokens can be used for various purposes. For example:

* **Digital collectibles and credentials**. NFTs can represent ownership of digital art, in-game assets, event tickets, or academic credentials.
* **Supply chain and asset tracking**. Tokens can represent physical items and track their journey across a supply chain.
* **Tokenized roles and permissions**. Roles within a decentralized system – such as operator, validator, or participant – can also be represented by unique native tokens. Holding a token grants permission to perform specific actions.
* **Access control and licensing**. A token could grant access to a service, event, or dataset. For example, holding a specific token could unlock premium features in a DApp or grant entry to a token-gated community.  

* **Decentralized governance**. Native tokens can represent voting rights or stake in decision-making processes. This enables on-chain governance systems with transparent and auditable participation.
