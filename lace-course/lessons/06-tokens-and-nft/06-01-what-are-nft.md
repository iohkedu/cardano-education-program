# 6.1 What are native tokens and NFTs?

Tokens are user-created cryptocurrencies. Ada is created according to the rules for monetary expansion defined in protocols contained within the Cardano node. Users do not have a direct influence over monetary expansion and the creation of ada, except for voting on a potential government proposal that would change a monetary expansion parameter.

Users can create tokens on Cardano if they know how to use minting policies. These user-created tokens are called *native tokens,* because once created, they are treated the same way as ada. They can be sent to any address without restrictions and can be managed by smart contracts the same way as ada is.  

A minting policy is the computer code that a developer writes to set the rules by which native tokens can be created. For example, a condition in the policy could be that only an entity with a particular key can mint tokens, similar to a central bank that creates fiat currency.

A policy ID and the token name define a native token. Those two parameters define what we call an *asset class* or *asset ID* of a token. The policy ID represents a hash of the minting policy, meaning there is a direct link between the code of the minting policy and the policy ID.

A minting policy also allows the creation of a token that can exist only once. This means it has a unique minting policy. We refer to such a token as a *non-fungible token*, or NFT. In economics, fungibility refers to the property of commodities, such as gold coins or fiat currency, where units are interchangeable: 5 x $20 is equivalent to $100. NFTs are often used to embed images that can be seen in Lace. They can represent some artwork and can be sold on NFT exchanges.
