# 6.4 Buying and selling tokens on a DEX

A decentralized exchange (DEX) is an online marketplace where tokens are exchanged for ada or other Cardano native tokens. In a DEX, smart contracts handle the token exchange, meaning no central entity controls the assets on the exchange. Other blockchains that offer [Turing-complete](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/turing-completeness) smart contract capabilities may also be used to build a DEX.

This section explains how to purchase the USD-backed USDM stablecoin using [Minswap DEX](https://testnet-preprod.minswap.org/), as it offers trading functionality on the pre-production network, which is ideal for educational purposes. When deciding which DEX to use for trading on the mainnet, users can consult the [CardanoCube](https://www.cardanocube.com/cardano-ecosystem-interactive-map) interactive map, which categorizes projects building on Cardano under various categories, including exchanges and NFT and token minting. The [Cardano developers](https://developers.cardano.org/showcase/) showcase page offers similar functionality.

The tokens can now be traded back for ada or any other token. Purchasing USDM tokens on mainnet means they can be used in another DApp or at a store to pay for a product or service. Click the wallet address in the top right corner to disconnect from the exchange after completing the trade if desired. After that, the Minswap wallet appears, displaying the token balance.

Click the power button to disconnect the wallet.

Besides fiat-backed stablecoins, there are also algorithmic-backed stablecoins, where algorithms ensure the stability of the stablecoin. DJED is an overcollateralized stablecoin that uses ada as collateral to ensure stability. The protocol is backed by 400-800% overcollateralization and is guaranteed by its reserve coin, SHEN. The protocol eliminates the need for trust in a governance token, as seen in algorithmic stablecoins. The [DJED platform](https://www.djed.xyz/) is also fully decentralized and community-driven, allowing for open-source development and community involvement in minting and burning DJED and SHEN.
