# 3. Simple transactions and settings

This lesson describes the Lace walletâ€™s settings and explains how to use Lace to receive and send some test ada. Cardano has several networks, but only one - the mainnet - contains real ada. Other networks exist for testing purposes and contain *test ada,* which has no value and can be requested from the Cardano faucet for free. The functionality that Lace offers for test ada is the same as for real ada.
