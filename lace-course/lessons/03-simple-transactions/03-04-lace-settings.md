First, you will see the current account number and wallet name. As explained in the previous section, you can switch between multiple accounts in Lace, each with a unique address. If you click the pen button next to the arrow button at the top, a panel appears that allows you to modify the wallet and account names.

Below the wallet and account name, a status bar indicates whether or not the wallet is synced with the blockchain. Since the wallet needs to sync periodically, the status may occasionally display ‘*Not synced to the blockchain*’ or ‘*Wallet syncing*’. If these messages persist, you can also reopen the wallet to refresh the status. Once synced, the status will be ‘*Wallet synced*’. You can submit transactions no matter the status. Once the wallet is synced, the transaction will be broadcast to the network.

Quick settings include such options as:

* ***Add a new wallet***. You can add another wallet to Lace by creating a new wallet, importing an existing one, or connecting a hardware wallet.
* ***Address book***. You can store and view saved addresses associated with a user-defined name.
* ***Settings***. Opens up the full Lace settings window.
* ***Sign message***. Allows to cryptographically sign a user-defined message to prove the authenticity of the message.
* ***Light mode***. The toggle allows switching between light and dark mode.
* ***Nami mode***. The toggle allows switching between the Lace wallet and the [Nami wallet](https://www.namiwallet.io/), which is now part of Lace.
* ***Network***. Allows a user to switch the network to which Lace is connecting.

Click **Settings** to view the full Lace settings, which are grouped into six categories:

* ***Wallet***. Enables network selection, setting a local Cardano node and Cardano submit API, viewing authorized DApps, viewing public and staking keys, adding or removing collateral, and syncing a new address.
* ***Preferences***. Enables setting a local currency, choosing a theme, testing the beta program, and enabling console logging.
* ***Security***. Allows viewing the recovery phrase of the wallet and generating a paper wallet. For the paper wallet, a [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) public key needs to be generated.
* ***Support***. Provides links to the Lace FAQ page and the IO Zendesk page, where users can submit a support ticket for any issues they encounter.
* ***Legal***. Allows viewing of the terms and conditions, privacy policy, and cookie policy documents.
* ***Remove wallet***. Used to uninstall the wallet extension from the browser. The wallet can be restored at any time if the user has access to its recovery phrase. This action does not affect the wallet balance in any way.

After viewing the wallet settings, you can return to the main window by clicking **Tokens** on the right side.
