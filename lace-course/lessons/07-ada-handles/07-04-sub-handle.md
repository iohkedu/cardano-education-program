# 7.4 Sub-handles  

In addition to a root handle, it is possible to create sub-handles. A sub-handle is derived from a root handle. For example, from the handle lace_course, one can create the sub-handle `version-1@lace_course`. The root handle always appears after the ‘@’ symbol. There are two types of sub-handles: NFT sub-handles and virtual sub-handles. NFT sub-handles work the same way as root handles. Each one is an NFT sent to the address it should resolve to, just like any other NFT on Cardano. This means you can transfer ownership/control of sub-handles to another person, and once transferred, you lose ownership over them. Virtual sub-handles always remain under the control of the root handle owner. They cannot be transferred to someone else, but they can be set to resolve to any address. The root handle owner can revoke or change the address of a virtual sub-handle. Virtual sub-handles expire annually and must be renewed.

Owners can sell their sub-handles or allow the [handle.me](http://handle.me) website to do so for them via OAuth. You can set your own pricing and define up to five pricing tiers based on character length. Virtual sub-handles sold this way are flagged in the datum as *Public*. Public virtual sub-handles cannot be revoked or reassigned to a different address by the root handle owner until the expiration date. Private virtual sub-handles are minted directly by the root handle owner, using the key of the address where their root handle resides. Private virtual sub-handles can be revoked and reassigned at any time.  

A handle marketplace is at the time of writing being built in stages. It will serve as a one-stop shop for anything related to handles, including buying, selling, and renting handles and sub-handles. Additional features will be announced as development progresses.  

You can also personalize your sub-handle, as long as you enable the personalization option as a root handle owner. A sub-handle is personalized just like a regular handle. To check whether you are assigned a virtual sub-handle that is not an NFT, you can look at the datum stored on the blockchain at a smart contract. For this, go to [handle.me](http://handle.me) and connect your wallet. Then click the wallet icon in the top right corner, which opens a handle information side panel. All your wallet and assigned handles and sub-handles are displayed there. Virtual sub-handles will have a visual tag to indicate that this handle is assigned to you.  

When looking up handles on explorers, they may not always appear under the list of assets if an address contains two or more handles. You can also query handle information using a [public API](https://api.handle.me/swagger/%20), which can return sub-handle information. A Docker container for the decentralized API is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/koralabs/handles-public-api).
