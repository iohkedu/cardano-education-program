# 5.1 Cardano governance overview

A common question that emerges when people hear the term ‘governance’ in the blockchain space is, *why does a decentralized technology need to be governed?*

To answer this question, let’s imagine Cardano as if it were a digital nation. Just like any country, it needs a way for its citizens to decide how things should work, how resources are used, and how the community grows over time. This is what we refer to as *governance in Cardano*.

In Cardano’s ‘nation’, every ada holder is a *citizen*. Just as in the real world, citizens can have a say in how their country is run. The exciting part is that this power doesn’t belong to one government or one company. It belongs to *everyone who participates*.

To maintain a fair and transparent system, Cardano relies on a **constitution**. This document serves as a guiding framework, outlining the principles and values that all decisions must adhere to. It doesn’t control day-to-day operations, but it safeguards decentralization, fairness, and sustainability. You can read the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution on [this website](https://constitution.gov.tools/en).

Three main roles support Cardano governance operations:

* **Stake pool operators:** the backbone of the Cardano network. They run the stake pools, which are specialized servers that validate transactions and produce new blocks. By doing this, pools ensure the blockchain remains secure, reliable, and decentralized. Beyond maintaining the network, SPOs also play a crucial role in governance, as they review and vote on technical updates to the protocol, ensuring that changes are practical and beneficial for the system as a whole.

* **Delegated representatives (DReps):** DReps are community members who decide to represent ada holders and their voices in governance. Instead of voting directly on every proposal, ada holders can delegate their voting power to a DRep they trust. This enables experts, educators, or community leaders to thoroughly examine proposals and make informed decisions on behalf of many. DReps play a vital role in shaping Cardano’s future by deciding which projects, upgrades, or funding requests should move forward.

* **The constitutional committee (CC):** the CC acts as the guardian of Cardano’s values. Its role is not to decide what the community should do, but rather to ensure that every decision follows the principles set out in the Cardano constitution. They function much like referees in a game. They don’t play, but make sure everyone respects the rules. Committee members serve limited terms, allowing fresh perspectives to join regularly. Their oversight ensures the protection of decentralization, fairness, and sustainability, keeping the system aligned with its long-term vision.

When all these roles come together, governance actions become the primary tool for decision-making in Cardano.

A governance action is simply an idea or request for change. This could be adjusting a parameter in the network, funding a community project, or introducing a new feature.

Here’s how the process works:

1. A member of the Cardano community submits a proposal  
2. ada holders participate by voting directly or delegating their vote to a DRep  
3. DReps analyze and vote on behalf of those who delegated to them, bringing expertise and informed judgment  
4. SPOs cast their votes, especially on technical matters, ensuring the network remains secure and efficient  
5. The CC reviews the proposal to confirm it respects the Cardano constitution.

If the proposal passes through these steps, it can be implemented, funded, or integrated into the system.

In this way, Cardano governance is akin to a living democratic process: citizens (ada holders) propose ideas, representatives (DReps and SPOs) debate and vote, and referees (the CC) ensure that everything adheres to the core principles.

As a Cardano wallet, Lace plays a key role in governance by serving as the tool that connects ada holders to the decision-making process. The wallet allows ada holders to delegate their vote to a DRep, register themselves as a DRep or independent voter, cast votes on governance actions, and even submit proposals for changes or funding. In other words, Lace is the gateway that makes governance accessible, turning complex blockchain processes into simple actions for everyday Cardano users.

You will learn more about this in the forthcoming sections.
