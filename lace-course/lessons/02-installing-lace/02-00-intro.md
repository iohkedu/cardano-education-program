# 2. Installing and setting up Lace

This lesson covers the procedure for installing and setting up Lace, a lightweight Cardano wallet. If you already have a Cardano crypto wallet and want to start using Lace, refer to the last section, *Restoring an existing wallet* of this lesson.

The name Lace is derived from the name Lovelace, which was the last name of Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century English mathematician and writer who wrote the world's first computer program. She realized that computers would be able to do more than just calculate or perform number crunching (source: [simple wiki](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)). Cardanoâ€™s native currency is called ada, which is divided into lovelace. One million lovelace represents one ada.

We note that there are other wallets in the Cardano ecosystem, including:

* [Yoroi](https://yoroiwallet.com/), a lightweight wallet developed by Emurgo, a founding entity of Cardano
* [Etrnl](https://eternl.io/), a lightweight wallet developed by a company from the Cardano ecosystem
* [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/), a full-node wallet developed by IO.
