# 2.1 How to install Lace

At the time of writing, Lace is supported in Google Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers. Lace can also be installed on Chromium-based browsers, such as Brave; however, this has not been officially tested. The safest way to install Lace is to visit the [lace.io](http://lace.io) website. The **Add to browser** button at the top right corner leads to the Lace browser extension in the Chrome, Microsoft, and Firefox web stores. In the Chrome web store, you can also see a blue checkmark, and the tooltip explains why this browser extension is safe. Click **Install** and locate your extension in the *Extensions* settings page after installation.

Once Lace is installed, it will get automatically updated. You will see a notification window after opening Lace if the wallet has been updated, which will also list new features of Lace. You can check the Lace version in your browserâ€™s *Extensions* settings window.
