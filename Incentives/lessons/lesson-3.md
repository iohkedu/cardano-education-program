### Lesson 3: The "Goldilocks" Configuration

So, what's the ideal setup for Cardano? We want a balance.

* On one hand, having more stake pools increases **decentralization and security**.  
* On the other hand, too many pools can make the network less  
  **efficient**, both technically and financially. More pools mean more network traffic, more redundant data copies, and more operator rewards that need to be paid out.

It's a classic trade-off. To manage this, the Cardano incentives mechanism has a special protocol parameter, called **k**.

**The k parameter represents the desired number of equally-sized stake pools**.

The goal of the entire incentives mechanism is to naturally lead the network to a state where a solid majority of stake is delegated to k pools of a similar size, whose operators are reliable and contribute to the network's infrastructure.
