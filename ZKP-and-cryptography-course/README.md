# Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Cryptography Course  

## Introduction  

This self-paced course introduces the foundations of modern cryptography and its applications, with a special focus on the principles that underpin Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).  
It covers the essential building blocks of cryptographic systems, from symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to hashing, digital signatures, and advanced concepts such as secret sharing, key management, vulnerabilities, and cryptographic attacks.  

The course is designed to provide both theoretical understanding and practical insights into how cryptography is applied in secure communication, blockchain systems, and privacy-preserving technologies.

## How to Use This Course  

- **Prerequisites**:  
  - Basic mathematical background (algebra, probability).  
  - Familiarity with programming concepts (any language).  
  - No prior cryptography knowledge required.  

- **Recommended Order**:  
  The lessons are designed to be followed sequentially:  
  1. Start with the fundamentals of cryptography.  
  2. Progress through key building blocks like public-key systems, hashing, and digital signatures.  
  3. Advance to practical mechanisms like key exchange, secret sharing, and key management.  
  4. Conclude with lessons on vulnerabilities and attacks to understand real-world challenges.  

- **Learning Approach**:  
  - Read each lesson PDF carefully.  
  - Take notes and highlight key definitions (e.g., cryptosystem, one-way function, digital signature).  
  - Try to relate the theory with real-world use cases such as blockchain, secure messaging, and authentication.  
  - Review the vulnerabilities and attacks sections critically to understand common pitfalls in cryptographic systems.  

- **Practical Exercises**:  
  Complement your learning by implementing small coding exercises (e.g., simple hash functions, RSA encryption, or key exchange simulation).
