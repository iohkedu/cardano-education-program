## Blockchain evolution

This lesson covers the generations of blockchain and the problems they aimed to solve.

### First generation

The first generation marks the beginning of blockchains. Bitcoin is a first-generation blockchain, and its genesis block contained embedded text stating, '*The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks*'. This was the headline of a *Times* newspaper issue, referencing the 2008 financial crisis.

First-generation blockchains focus on peer-to-peer transactions without relying on a central authority or intermediaries. Traditionally, sending money across continents could take days or even weeks. With blockchain, transactions go directly to the recipient and settle within minutes. There’s also the issue of trust. For example, when withdrawing your own money, banks can sometimes refuse access – something that has happened before and, unfortunately, has become more common today.

### Second generation

If the first generation focused on trustless peer-to-peer transactions, the second generation introduced smart contracts. In the first generation, transactions were limited to transferring cryptocurrency without intermediaries, with a simple check to verify that the sender had sufficient balance. Second-generation blockchains extended this by allowing additional conditions on transactions through smart contracts. These are pieces of programmable logic that define and enforce custom rules – for example, preventing a withdrawal until a specific time has passed. This innovation enabled escrow, conditional payments, timed releases, and other programmable financial behaviors. Ethereum is the best-known example of a second-generation blockchain.

### Third generation

After second-generation blockchains introduced smart contracts, innovative concepts such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized applications (DApps) emerged. However, with growing demand, scalability became a major challenge. Another issue was developer compensation. Many projects rewarded developers with pre-mined coins – meaning they mined blocks and received rewards with little competition when the user base was still small. Some developers sold their holdings and left, while others stayed, benefiting from price appreciation. This approach relied heavily on individual trust and proved unsustainable in the long term. Third-generation blockchains addressed these challenges by introducing a treasury system, enabling self-sustainability through on-chain funding for future development. They also emphasized interoperability – the ability of blockchains to communicate and exchange data – which paved the way for layer 2 solutions and sidechains, improving scalability. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain.
