## **Blockchain Evolution**

This lesson will cover the generations of blockchain and the problems they aimed to solve.

### 1st generation

The 1st generation is the upcoming of blockchains. Bitcoin is a first generation blockchain and its genesis block had an embedded text saying "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". It was the headline of an issue of The Times newspaper and we all know a financial crisis happened in 2008.

1st generation blockchains are focused on peer to peer transactions without relying on a central authority or any intermediaries. It takes days or occasionally weeks to send money to someone in another continent. Blockchain transactions would go directly to the recipient and settled in minutes. There is also an issue of trust. For instance, when you are withdrawing your own money, banks can refuse to give it to you which has happened before and it is more common nowadays.

### 2nd generation

If 1st generation was about trustless peer to peer transactions, 2nd generation is about smart contracts. In the 1st generations, transactions with the sole purpose of sending cryptocurrency without middlemen, had a simple condition of checking if the balance is enough to make this transaction. Second-generation blockchains enable placing more conditions on transactions through smart contracts. See, smart contracts are just arbitrary logic which is custom extra conditions put on transactions. Blockchain transactions are no longer limited to a plain transfer of coins from sender to receiver. Smart contracts let you encode and enforce arbitrary conditions on those transfers like no one can withdraw until a specific time has elapsed. This enables escrow, conditional payments, timed releases, and many other programmable financial behaviours. For instance, Ethereum is a 2nd generation blockchain.

### 3rd generation

After 2nd generations introduced smart contracts, innovative concepts like decentralized exchange (DEX), decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), stablecoins, NFTs and decentralized applications (DApp) came into life. With soaring demand, it was hard to keep up, and scalability became an issue. Another problem was that developers were compensated with pre-mined coins, or in other words, they mined blocks and collected mining rewards without much competition, especially when the user base was still small. Some cashed out their gains and left the project, while others continued to work, enjoying the price appreciation. However, it still relied on trust and depended entirely on the individuals, making it unsustainable in the long term. 3rd generation blockchains address this issue by using a treasury, allowing the blockchain to sustain itself by financing development from its own funds. Interoperability is the final pillar of third-generation blockchains. The ability for blockchains to interact with one another enabled the development of Layer 2 solutions and sidechains, contributing to scalability to some extent. Cardano is a 3rd generation blockchain.
