## **Decentralization**

Before diving into technical details, this lesson will try to explain the depth of the de-centralized concept and what it means to be not centralized because decentralization is the most fundamental principle for blockchains.

### Lack of Standards

Blockchain as an industry is in one of it's early stages. One thing thatâ€™s still missing for it to fully mature is **standards** such as how to measure decentralization or what makes a blockchain great blockchain. Is a fast blockchain the best or is it very secure one that is considered great blockchain? Perhaps very decentralized blockchain?  
Well, there are not enough standards so far to answer that question.

### "Decentralized"

As discussed before, blockchain is a system of many participants reaching a consensus without any authority. Consensus is reached through either following majority or everyone's agreement. Now let's see some examples to get a deeper understanding because it's not easy to say a blockchain is decentralized.

* Distribution of coins could be well formed which means large percentage is not owned by few and disparity is minimal. It might seem decentralized here but if 80% of the newly created coins are going to a handful of people, then it doesn't seem so decentralized now, is it?
* Anyone can access and use the blockchain but what about, that in order to participate in the consensus process, it needs approval of majority from existing consensus participants. Even though the existing participants are welcoming new participants so openly, that still means they need to be trusted to an extent, otherwise at any moment, they can collectively shut the door.
* Regarding governance, who is deciding and guiding the new developments or changes to the blockchain. Are regular holders' input taken into account or only developers' opinion matter?

As you can see, decentralization can take any form in many aspects of blockchain. It's obvious that doing something in a decentralized manner is tough and inefficient at times. For instance, getting a transaction verified by single entity to process it, is efficient and faster by an order of magnitude, than collecting everyone's verification. Sometimes, it is evident that gains have been prioritized, at the cost of losing a bit of decentralization. It could be something simple as, instead of getting verified by everyone, 99% becomes threshold and sufficient to say a transaction is done. 1% may be insignificant but it could gain 10% in throughput.

Blockchain or the first blockchain(Bitcoin) is said to be invented due to loss of trust in centralized power like big corporations and institutions. And losing some degree of decentralization, even little bit, shouldn't be acceptable. A counterargument for trying to trade it for speed is that we as a civilization already have a solution for fast transaction processing system which can handle thousands of transactions per second. Furthermore, if the speed of blockchain is all we care about, then making it fully centralized would solve the problem. But that would defeat the purpose of blockchain, wouldn't it. Like adding more lines to road doesn't solve traffic jam, it's not sustainable in the long run. And it's more or less the same case for every other kinds of gains by centralization. Decentralization makes trust worthless and it's existence no longer matter that's why decentralization is also a fundamental principle which, unfortunately, not enough people appreciate. 

There is an effort from *University of Edinburgh* to measure decentralization and it is [Edinburgh Decentralisation Index](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/blockchain/edi).
