## Decentralization

Decentralization is one of the most fundamental principles of blockchain technology. But before diving into technical details, let’s first explore what decentralization means – and, just as importantly, what it means *not* to be centralized. 

### Lack of standards

Blockchain technology is still in its early stages as an industry. One key element missing from its maturity is a set of **standards** – for example, how to measure decentralization or how to define what makes a blockchain ‘great’.

Is the best blockchain the fastest one? The most secure? Or perhaps the most decentralized? There are currently no universal standards to answer these questions.

### Understanding decentralization

As discussed earlier, a blockchain is a system in which multiple participants reach consensus without relying on a central authority. Consensus is achieved through collective agreement, typically by following the majority or requiring unanimous participation.

However, determining whether a blockchain is *truly* decentralized isn’t straightforward. Let’s look at a few examples that show why:

* A blockchain might have a fair distribution of coins, where no small group owns a large percentage. But if 80% of newly created coins consistently go to just a few participants, that network isn’t as decentralized as it seems.
* A blockchain might be open for anyone to access and use, but what if joining the consensus process requires approval from existing validators? Even if those validators are welcoming, the system still depends on their collective permission, making it partly centralized.
* Governance is another factor: who decides on protocol updates or new features? Are everyday token holders included in these decisions, or is it limited to developers or core contributors?

As these examples demonstrate, decentralization can be applied across various aspects of a blockchain, including coin distribution and validation, governance, and development.

Achieving decentralization is not easy, and it can often lead to reduced efficiency. For instance, having a single entity verify transactions is much faster than requiring thousands of participants to do so. Some projects, therefore, choose to sacrifice a small degree of decentralization for performance gains – perhaps accepting a 99% consensus instead of a 100% one to boost throughput. While this trade-off may seem minor, it has meaningful implications.

The first blockchain, Bitcoin, was created as a response to the loss of trust in centralized institutions and corporations. Losing even a small degree of decentralization undermines that purpose. If speed were the only goal, a fully centralized system could easily achieve it – but that would defeat the entire purpose of blockchain.

As the saying goes, 'Adding more lanes doesn’t solve traffic jams – it just shifts the problem elsewhere'. Similarly, centralization might offer short-term gains, but it sacrifices long-term resilience and trust. Decentralization, by contrast, removes the need for trust altogether, making systems inherently fair and transparent. Unfortunately, it remains one of blockchain’s least appreciated but most essential principles.

For those interested in learning more, the [Edinburgh Decentralisation Index](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/blockchain/edi) from the University of Edinburgh is an effort to quantify and measure decentralization across blockchain networks.
