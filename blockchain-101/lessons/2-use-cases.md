## Use cases

Now that we have this special notebook, what can we actually do with it? Or better yet, what should we write in it, since we can record anything we want?

### Magical stamp

The 'magical stamp' creates the essential link between pages. This link makes it nearly impossible to modify or erase a page without affecting all the pages that follow.

Because each stamp is generated from the content of its corresponding page, any change to the content will also change the stamp. If a page is altered, it must be re-stamped – but that new stamp will no longer match the next page, which contains the previous stamp as part of its own content. This creates a ripple effect: every page after the modified one would also need new stamps to stay valid.

Deleting a page causes a similar issue, since the chain must remain continuous. The next page would need to link back to the page preceding the deleted one to maintain the chain's validity.

### Where can we use it?

Because it’s so difficult to change information deep in the 'notebook', blockchain is best suited for data that should remain permanent. Examples include medical records, academic transcripts, and financial transactions.

This doesn’t mean mistakes can’t be corrected. If wrong information is recorded, a new entry can simply note what was incorrect and why. There’s even a saying in the blockchain world: 'You don’t delete data – you just add another entry saying it’s deleted'. Deletion, in this sense, means adding information, not removing it.

### Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is the most well-known and widely used application of blockchain. At its core, it’s just numbers stored digitally – much like the numbers in a bank account balance.

Cryptocurrencies add a key element: incentives. They reward participants for maintaining and securing the blockchain network. While it’s possible to have a blockchain without cryptocurrency, public blockchains typically include one to motivate users to contribute computing power and resources. Private blockchains, however, can function without a native currency, as participants are usually incentivized through other means.
