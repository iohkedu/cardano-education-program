## Distributed ledger

Blockchain is described as both distributed and decentralized. This lesson explores what ‘distributed’ means, and the next one discusses decentralization in more detail.

### Financial transactions

In traditional banking, transactions are verified and processed by an employee, and for larger amounts, perhaps by a supervisor or branch director. This means there is always an authority deciding what is valid or invalid.

Blockchains, however, have no such central authority — everyone is equal. Each transaction must be verified and accepted by all participants before being added to the ledger.

A ledger is simply a record book of economic transactions (a kind of notebook, as discussed before). Now imagine needing thousands of people to validate each transaction! Even digitally, that requires a significant amount of time and effort.

### Distributed ledger technology

A system is called distributed ledger technology (DLT) when all participants have equal rights (with no central authority that could become a single point of failure) and reach agreement – known as consensus – while being spread across many locations. But there’s a challenge. If everyone has equal power, it’s like a crew of pirates trying to elect a captain – everyone votes for themselves. To avoid chaos, the system employs a consensus algorithm – a method by which all participants agree to follow the valid state of the ledger.

Blockchain is the most common form of DLT. Because its data is stored as a sequence of linked blocks, its structure is linear. Other DLTs may use different data structures, such as graphs.

In short, blockchain relies on a consensus algorithm so that all participants eventually share the same ledger. While they might not be perfectly synchronized at every moment, they will converge to the same state if they follow the consensus rules honestly.

### Distributed v decentralized

Participants spread across the world form a network that is distributed geographically, but decentralization means something more. ‘Distributed’ refers to the physical spread of participants or data, while ‘decentralized’ describes how much control or authority is shared among them.

Let’s look at some examples to illustrate the difference:

* **Distributed** and **decentralized**: blockchain
* **Distributed** but **centralized**: search engines like Google – data is replicated across many servers, but control belongs to one authority
* **Not distributed** but **decentralized**: Linux systems – open source and community-driven, but each installation runs locally
* **Not distributed** and **centralized**: Windows, macOS – owned and controlled by a single entity and installed on individual machines.

Note: These examples are simplified for illustration. Decentralization is more complex than it seems. Even an open-source project can be centralized if only a small group of developers control access or decision-making.
