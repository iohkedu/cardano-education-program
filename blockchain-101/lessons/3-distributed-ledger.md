## **Distributed Ledger**

Blockchain is said to be distributed and decentralized. In this lesson, let's talk about what does it mean to be distributed and the latter in the next.

### Financial transactions

In traditional banks, transactions are verified and processed by a single employee and, for large amounts, perhaps a supervisor and/or branch director are involved. It means that there is an authority which decides what is right and wrong. Blockchains don't have any authority to say which is what, thus, everyone is equal. So each transaction needs to be verified by everyone and accepted which means to be added to a ledger. What is a ledger? Well it's a book for registering economic transactions (Book.. Notebook.. more or less, same thing). Can you imagine that in order to make a single transaction, you are going to get thousands of people to validate it? Even digitally, that's a lot of time and effort.

### Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

It is called Distributed Ledger Technology when a system has participants with equal rights (or without central authority which might become single point of failure) and they reach a consensus while being spread across many locations. But there is one problem. If everyone is peer or equal, then it will be like a classic idea of pirates electing a captain which never happens because everyone votes for themselves. So how they reach a consensus is through unanimously agreed **consensus algorithm**.

Blockchain is the most common type of DLT. Seeing blockchain is sequential due to chained blocks, it is linear in terms of data structure. Another type of DLT uses graphs.

So blockchain uses consensus algorithm to reach a consensus and everyone has the same ledger or notebook. It's worth to mention that everyone doesn't necessarily have the exact same ledger at any moment of time but eventually everyone reaches the same ledger state if they follow the consensus algorithm honestly.

### Distributed vs Decentralized

Participants being distributed all over the world might seem decentralized geographically but there is a slight difference between distributed and decentralized. Distributed is about mere locations. Decentralized is a characteristic that is quantifiable and qualitative in many aspects. Also decentralization is a fundamental principle of blockchains which we will cover in the next lesson. Let's take the following examples to see the difference between the two attributes:
* **Distributed**, **Decentralized**: Blockchain
* **Distributed**, **Centralized**: Search engine - Google  
Data is distributed and replicated across servers that are in multiple locations but a single authority manages it
* **Not Distributed**, **Decentralized**: Linux systems  
It's open source but it's in single location like a computer running Linux operating system.
* **Not Distributed**, **Centralized**: Windows, MacOS  
It's owned and developed by a central authority and it's only in single place that it's installed on.

Note: The examples are only for the purpose of illustrating the difference between the two and it might not be accurate. Decentralization is not so shallow that one might think such as even if the project is open source, when the developers are not letting anyone new in, that is very much centralized to a closed group of people.
