## Chain of blocks

The name **blockchain** comes from combining the words *block* and *chain*. Interestingly, in the first blockchain’s whitepaper – that of Bitcoin – the term blockchain was never mentioned. So what is a blockchain – or in other words, a chain of blocks?

### What is a blockchain?

In simple terms, imagine a notebook that can have pages added endlessly. But here’s the twist – it’s a very special notebook. Each page must include two 'magical stamps'. These stamps are generated based on the page's content, ensuring that every page is unique.

For example, imagine that _Stamp A_ belongs to a page containing the word **Cardano**. Every page with that same word would have _Stamp A_. However, in this notebook, each page also includes the previous page’s stamp. This links the pages together. It also means that even if all pages had the same text, their stamps would still differ – because each one depends on the stamp from the previous page. The only exception is the very first page, which has no predecessor and therefore only carries _Stamp A_.

This structure links the pages together like a chain. If we think of each page as a *block*, we now have a _chain of blocks_ – a **blockchain**. A block represents a collection of data, much like a page can hold written content. In a notebook, each page might include extra details, such as a page number, to keep things organized. Similarly, in a blockchain, each block includes its own important piece of information – the magical stamp – which helps maintain order and connection across the entire chain.

Of course, this magic isn’t fantasy – it’s the power of **mathematics and cryptography**, which we’ll explore in another lesson.

### Private and public blockchains

Blockchains can be categorized in different ways. One common distinction is between *private* and *public* blockchains – and it all comes down to access control. 

If anyone can freely access and participate in the network, it’s a public blockchain. This course will focus on public blockchains. From here on, when we use the term *blockchain*, it will refer to a public blockchain unless stated otherwise.

In a private blockchain, on the other hand, access is limited to a selected group of people or organizations – a closed circle rather than an open network.
