## Chain of blocks

The name **blockchain** comes from combining the words *block* and *chain*. Interestingly, in the first blockchain’s whitepaper – that of Bitcoin – the term blockchain was never mentioned. So what exactly is a blockchain, or a chain of blocks?

### What is a blockchain?

In simple terms, imagine a notebook that can have pages added endlessly. But here’s the twist – it’s a very special notebook. Each page must include two 'magical stamps'. These stamps are magical because their creation depends on the page’s content, as if the page stamps itself.

For example, imagine that _Stamp A_ belongs to a page containing the word **Cardano**. Every page with that same word would have _Stamp A_. However, in this notebook, each page also includes the previous page’s stamp. This links the pages together. It also means that even if all pages had the same text, their stamps would still differ – because each one depends on the stamp from the previous page. The only exception is the very first page, which has no predecessor and therefore only carries _Stamp A_.

This structure links pages like a chain. If we think of each page as a **block**, we now have a _chain of blocks_ – a **blockchain**. A _block_ is simply a set of data that can store any kind of information, much like how a page can contain any text. Each block also carries extra details, such as its position in the chain and those special stamps.

Of course, this magic isn’t fantasy – it’s the power of **mathematics and cryptography**, which we’ll explore in the next lesson.

### Private and public blockchains

Blockchains can be categorized in different ways. One common distinction is between *private* and *public* blockchains – and it all comes down to access control. 

If anyone can freely access and participate in the network, it’s a public blockchain. This course will focus on public blockchains. From here on, when we use the term *blockchain*, it will refer to a public blockchain unless stated otherwise.

In a private blockchain, on the other hand, access is limited to a selected group of people or organizations – a closed circle rather than an open network.
