## **Chain of blocks**

The name **Blockchain** came from two words **Block** and **Chain** combined together. In the first blockchain (**Bitcoin**)'s whitepaper, the word **blockchain** was not mentioned at all. So what is blockchain? ...or maybe chain of blocks?

### What is blockchain?

In simple terms, think of it as a notebook that can have pages added indefinitely but here is the catch, it's a very special notebook beside unlimited pages. Each page of the notebook has to have 2 magical stamps. What makes these stamps magical is that it's generation is dependent on the page content as if it is stamping the page.

Let's say that, *Stamp A* is for a page with text *"Cardano"*. If all pages with only **Cardano** word are stamped, then they all will have *Stamp A*. Moreover, each page has it's own stamp and previous page's stamp which makes link between pages. It also means that even if all pages had the same text, each page will have different stamps because previous page's stamp counts as part of the content, therefore, each page stamp will be generated on different content. Only the first page of the notebook is the exception because it has no previous page and it will have the Stamp A.

It is now that pages are linked together like a chain. If we call the pages as blocks, then it is a *chain of blocks* ...or **blockchain**. **Block** is actually a set of data that can contain any information you want as same as, on a page, you can write anything you want. Additionally, there are few more little information on top of something you wrote. In case of pages, it'll be like page numbers, the magical stamp and more.

The magic we are talking about here is not fairy tale because it's real and power of mathematics which we will talk in detail in **Cryptography**.

### Private and Public blockchains

Blockchains can be categorized in many ways. One of them would be **Private** and **Public**. It's all about access control. If anyone can access and participate in the blockchain freely, then it is **Public blockchain**, on which we will solely focus in this course. In subsequent lessons, the term blockchain will refer specifically to public blockchain unless explicitly said private or public. **Private blockchain** is the opposite, where the access is restricted or the participants are closed circle of people or entities.
