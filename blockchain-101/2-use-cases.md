## **Use Cases**

Now that we have this special notebook. What can we do with it? The better question is, what should we write on it since we can write anything we want?

### Magical Stamp

The magical stamp makes the essential link between adjacent pages. Furthermore, what the link enables is that in order to modify or even erase the page followed by lots of pages, all the following pages must be updated accordingly. Because magical stamps are generated from the page content and if the content is modified, then the page stamp will have to be different from the stamp that was made before the change, otherwise it will invalidate the page. The page could be stamped again so that it would have valid stamp but that would create a new stamp on the page. As a result, it leads to a cascade of problems. The very next page would have to have this new stamp and get itself a new stamp as well too because each page has to have 2 stamps, one for itself and another from previous page. And that creates a ripple effect where all the following pages after the modified page must be changed or it will become invalid pages. Erasing a page is almost the same thing as the next page needs to have the stamp from the previous page of the erased page to make the chain gapless and valid.

### Where can we use it

As we just saw, it's very difficult to modify pages deep in the notebook. So the best fitting would be something we don't want to change afterwards. To name a few, medical records, academic transcripts and financial transactions. By the way, it doesn't mean that a mistake cannot be fixed. For instance, if a wrong information is written then additionally writing which information is wrong and why will suffice. That's why there exists a joke that says, you don't truly delete something on blockchain because deleting just adds another entry saying it is deleted. (Deletion is not removing at all but adding.)

### Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is probably the best applied use case of blockchain because deep down it is only numbers in terms of storage as same as money on banks' balance sheets are only numbers like the balance of your bank accounts. Moreover, it gives monetary incentives to participants. It is possible have a blockchain without any cryptocurrency but not a lot of people will use it without proper incentives. Who will pay for running it, electricity and computations. So public blockchains tend to have it's own cryptocurrencies and private blockchains can live without them as participants are incentivized by other means.
